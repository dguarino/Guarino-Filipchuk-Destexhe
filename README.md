The [`GuarinoFilipchukDestexhe` Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dguarino/Guarino-Filipchuk-Destexhe/blob/main/GuarinoFilipchukDestexhe.ipynb) performs loading and selection of the MICrONS data, structural and dynamical analyses, and plots the results as in the paper panels.     

All the code is hosted on this github repository (with a Zenodo DOI persistent identifier [here](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/498655295)) and can be interactively executed here [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dguarino/Guarino-Filipchuk-Destexhe/HEAD)

This repository also contains a copy of some required data files from the [MICrONS project phase1](https://www.microns-explorer.org/phase1), to ease the setup on Binder. The rest is downloaded from the MICrONS website at binder runtime.
