    "## Fixed-point attractor analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been proposed (by Carrillo-Reid and Yuste, among others) that reproducible patterns are attractors of the cortical dynamics. By the methods used to characterize these \"attractors\" it is understood that [fixed-point attractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Fixed_point) are meant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the presence of attractors is justified by showing the reproducibility of some patterns. Here, we test their presence using more stringent methods.     \n",
    "We base our treatment of the concept of attractor on the work of [Milnor 1985](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01212280). To search for attractors in experimental data (no characteristic equation given), we will use the approach outlined by [Andy Wuensche](http://www.ddlab.com/boa_idea.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a network of size $N$ ($N$-dimensional), we use the joint activity of its $N$ units at each time-point $t$ to characterise its dynamics.      \n",
    "An example **state** at time $t$ is $B = [1,0,1,0,...,0,1,1,0]$.    \n",
    "The *state-space* - the space of all possible bitstrings or patterns - is made of all $2^n$ states.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A **trajectory** in state-space, is made of $B$, its *predecessor* $A$, and its *successor* $C$.    \n",
    "The state $B$ may have other predecessor states besides $A$, the total is its *in-degree*.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **attractor** is a subset of the state-space such that:\n",
    "1. It is *forward invariant*: if one state is part of a trajectory leading to the attractor, its next state should be part of the trajectory as well.\n",
    "1. It has a *neighborhood*: a set of in-degree predecessors.\n",
    "1. No subset of the attractor has the above two properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, \n",
    "- a *state* is a frame sample (ms), with $N$ being the number of recorded cells\n",
    "- a *population event* is a *set of states*, which might or not be a *trajectory*\n",
    "- a *fixed-point attractor* is represented by a series of population events (trajectories)   \n",
    "\n",
    "where population events and clusters of events are defined by the above procedure (in `dynamical_analysis.ipynb`).    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to search for dynamical attractors\n",
    "If it is true that reproducible population event patterns are attactors of the cortical dynamic, they should be already visible adopting a common strategy of dimensionality reduction (e.g. through PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "We should find that:\n",
    "- If the events clustered are realizations of an attractor, then the states constituting each event should \n",
    "    1. form a trajectory (property 1 above)\n",
    "    1. be linked in a chain of predecessors-successors, i.e. a trajectory (beginning of property 2 above)\n",
    "- If trajectories are found, they should form a *transient-tree*, a set of nested trajectories, also called *basin of attraction*. In particular, we should:\n",
    "    3. find that several trajectories are lying over the same principal component axes (completion of property 2 above).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using sklearn preprocessing and decomposition libraries. All figures below are interactive, to enable closer inspection."
